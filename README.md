# the_couch_gourmet

This is a restaurant review app built using React, Express and MongoDB Atlas. Users can choose to register an account as either a restaurant or as a patron. Depending on which they choose they will be given a slightly different user experience. Restaurants can post their establishment in the feed with a name, an about section and can upload an image. Their restaurant will then be able to receive reviews. Patrons can provide a name, an about section and a favorite cuisine section. Once they are logged in they are able to submit reviews on restaurants. They can also view all of their reviews and edit or delete them. Both types of users can edit their profiles. Eventually we would like to incorporate Google maps for restaurant and patron locations.
