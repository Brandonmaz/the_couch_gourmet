    about: "Unrivalled views of the French Riviera, three levels of cascading vegetable gardens churning out the sweetest produce and a team of outrageously talented cooks and front-of-house staff combine to make Mirazur the ultimate restaurant experience. Mauro Colagreco’s unique cuisine is inspired by the sea, the mountains and the restaurant’s own gardens, including Menton’s emblematic citrus fruits."

    "It’s fair to say that 2019 was Mauro Colagreco’s year. Steadily ascending The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list since its debut at No.35 in 2009, Mirazur celebrated 10 years in the ranking by rising to No.1. The accolade coincided with the restaurant finally achieving the coveted three Michelin stars, as well as the beginning of a three-year renovation project involving a new dining room, extensions to the vegetable gardens and a more immersive dining experience.",

    about:"The original Noma was, undoubtedly, one of the most important restaurants of its generation. With his food, René Redzepi developed a new genre of cuisine. New Nordic cookery looks back to look ahead; digging deeper than seasonality to explore unsung foraged products, while seamlessly weaving in a study of fermentation. Redzepi’s visionary approach to celebrating terroir via ingredient-focused, minimalist plates earned the first incarnation of Noma the title of The World’s Best Restaurant in four years: 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014."

    "Redzepi closed the original Noma in February 2017. He moved the restaurant from Copenhagen’s Christianshavn neighbourhood to a more spacious plot on artsy Refshalevej Island, with the new restaurant’s first service taking place in February 2018. Under the Best of the Best rules, the new Noma is a separate restaurant than its original location, and therefore earns the Highest New Entry Award debuting on this year's list at No.2.",

    about:"What makes it special: Chef Victor Arguinzoniz has a remarkable ability to coax out explosive flavour from seemingly simple ingredients, most of which are grilled over an open hearth."

    "The restaurant respects the intrinsic natural flavours of local produce and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: goat’s milk churned into ethereal butter, green peas amplified in their own juice, beef dry aged for so many days it bites with umami. Arguinzoniz cooks vegetables and proteins on a range of charcoals he makes from a variety of woods, kissing most plates with at least a suggestion of smoke.",

    about: "For four years in a row (2014-2018), Gaggan was voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, a testament to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which are eaten with the hands."

    "While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka, Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la Nature Goh.",

    about: "Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting and unique produce from land, sea and mountains."

    "Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire, sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20m below sea level to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.",

    about: "One of a handful of cooks who have remained at the top of global fine dining for decades, Alain Passard needs little introduction. He has retained three Michelin stars at Arpège for more than two decades during times of great personal and culinary change, and in 2019 he was the recipient of the Chefs’ Choice Award, sponsored by Estrella Damm, at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards in Singapore."

    "Vegetables, in short. Passard famously in 2001 announced that Arpège – until then a meat institution – was turning vegetarian, and although meat has since returned to the restaurant in smaller quantities, vegetables still take the main stage. They arrive daily from Passard’s own farms and appear on diners’ plates soon after.",

    about: "When Peru meets Japan on the plate, Nikkei is born – and chef Mitsuharu ‘Micha’ Tsumura is the Nikkei king. This translates to a welcoming spot where fresh fish and citrus-packed sauces reign supreme. Little wonder it was voted The Best Restaurant in Latin America in both 2017 and 2018."

    "Tsumura’s Nikkei Experience menu is a journey through Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood. There is succulent cod marinated in miso with crispy nuts, nigiri sushi, sea urchin rice, the now-legendary 50-hour-cooked beef short rib and even tofu cheesecake ice cream. Everything sings with flavour, zing and the natural bright colours that come from Peru’s produce. There’s also a separate sushi counter and menu for regular or business diners.",

    about: "Septime is a super-cool place on a cool street run by cool people, frequented by cool customers. The food is relaxed, packed with flavour and served without pretention. Hyper-sustainable Septime was also the winner of the Sustainable Restaurant Award in 2017."

    "One of the biggest charms of this neo-industrial is its fair pricing: €60 for four courses and €95 for seven courses. Chef Bertrand Grébaut’s seasonal, modern French plates have been luring in diners from around the world since the cosy restaurant’s opening eight years ago. The food is sophisticated and uses some of the finest producers from around the world but, unlike some of its neighbouring restaurants, doesn’t feel the need to shout about them. The dishes themselves do the talking. Expect inspired plates like egg yolk cured in salted pimento vinegar with raw cuttlefish, lardo, and pimento oil; and beets cooked in a brown butter, with red sorrel, and a sauce made from red wine and tuna bones.",

    about: "After the success of their original restaurant Twins, identical brothers Ivan and Sergey Berezutskiy had a bigger dream: to be able to supply their own produce. Their farm outside Moscow now turns out 70% of the ingredients used at Twins Garden, and leftovers are sent back to feed the animals, making this an almost zero-waste operation."

    "Two different degustation options served at the chefs’ table include the vegetable-only Garden menu, and the more varied Twins tasting. Both rely heavily on produce from the farm, and include a journey through the restaurant’s extensive wine room, laboratory and kitchen for different courses. There is also an à la carte menu serving salads of vegetables delivered from the farm that morning, or pumpkin soup with sea urchin caviar and quail’s egg.",

    about: " Frantzén is back with a bang. From humble origins as a bijou dining room in Stockholm’s old town, Frantzén shut up shop in 2016 to relocate to larger premises. Set across three storeys of a spruced-up 19th-century townhouse in the Norrmalm district, the restaurant re-opened a year later to justified rapture."

    "Frantzén’s food is a unique hybrid of Nordic cuisine that marries classic and modern techniques inspired by local and international tradition with Asian notes. Dishes include the likes of langoustine tail fried with puffed rice and a clarified butter and ginger dip, Japanese egg custard with pork broth, chives and umami seaweed-dusted crisp skin and the iconic Fattiga riddare, a fried toast of sorts with truffle, onions, cheese and 100-year-old balsamic vinegar.",

    about:"Yoshihiro Narisawa left home at 19 and spent eight years cutting his teeth in some of Europe’s most venerated kitchens, including those of the late Paul Bocuse and Joël Robuchon. In 1996, he returned home to Japan and opened La Napoule in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven years later, he moved to his current space in Tokyo’s non-touristy district of Minami Aoyama and formed Les Créations de Narisawa. After eight years of service, he renamed the restaurant simply Narisawa."

    " Narisawa defines his food as “innovative Satoyama,” the word “Satoyama” representing a border zone between mountain foothills and flat land where people live sustainably with nature. Diners fall under the spell of the season, and sample fleeting flavours from provinces around the country. Depending on the season, some might try a broth made from a poisonous snake that resides in the waters near Okinawa, or a warm sashimi course of langoustine from Suruga Bay.",

    about:"A taste of Piedmont, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual."

    "The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21...31...41...51... which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own garden – that linger longest in diners’ memories.",

    about: "All the beef at Don Julio is from grass-fed Aberdeen Angus and Hereford cattle, raised in the countryside outside Buenos Aires. It is stored in a climate-controlled refrigerator for at least 21 days to reach optimum maturity. Then grillmaster Bienvenido ‘Pepe’ Sotelo cooks all the beef on a traditional “V” iron grill. Match with beautiful Malbec for the full experience."

    "While Don Julio serves pretty much every part of the cow, owner Pablo Rivero recommends ordering house cuts like bife de cuadril (rump steak) and entraña (skirt steak). For a starter, opt for the fried beef empanadas and the crispy mollejas (sweetbreads), which are lightly seasoned with just lemon juice and salt.",

    about: "Perched on a steep hillside in Cow Hollow, San Francisco, Atelier Crenn is a serene escape from the city. Complementing the calm interior and cosy dining room is Dominique Crenn’s elegant cuisine, inspired by her childhood and her artist father."

    "Based on the concept of Poetic Culinaria, Crenn’s tasting menu takes diners through a poetic sequence of stunning dishes that may include spiny lobster and its essence, geoduck tart with oyster and rosé and brioche with house-cultured butter. Superb wine pairings and seamless service are led by charming general manager Maxime Larquier, while pastry chef Juan Contreras produces iconic desserts such as the much-photographed Coconut and Pineapple. Everything is balanced so that guests leave satisfied but never uncomfortably full.",

    about:"Le Bernardin offers several tasting menu options. The classic four-course menu is split into three sections – Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked – with dishes marrying French and global influences, especially those from Asia. Think kampachi sashimi with Niçoise olives and a Greek-inspired salad; and seared octopus with tomatillo salsa and red wine-mole sauce."

    "Le Bernardin’s long-time wine director Aldo Sohm has earned a reputation as one of Manhattan’s top sommeliers, having received the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009. Expanding upon Le Bernardin’s French-focused list of wines that complement fish, in 2014 he and Ripert opened upscale Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, just steps away.",

    about:"The key ingredient infused into every Alinea meal isn’t a mountain of caviar, or a fat puck of foie gras. Since Alinea’s debut in 2005, chef and owner Grant Achatz has built a reputation for designing dishes spiked with emotion; eliciting playful nostalgia from his diners via sophisticated riffs off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or pheasant served with smouldering oak leaves he calls Aromas of Fall."

    "Alinea has kept itself at the forefront of modern creativity via edible vanilla beans, langoustine yuba, crystal-clear pumpkin pie and what has become Alinea’s most famous dish: an edible, helium-filled, floating balloon designed by former executive chef Mike Bagale.",

Pronounced Hi-sha Franko, the restaurant is located in the stunning surrounds of the Soča Valley and has drawn visitors to Slovenia from all over the world."

    "Roš and her team offer an eleven-course tasting menu based on seasonal produce, which may start with the restaurant’s homemade spelt sour dough, pumpkin seed meringue with trout liver and local smoked cheese. The rest of the menu might include anything from the chef’s 'no waste' salami broth – a recipe she learnt from her father –, pulled Drežnica lamb and crab, or sole in its own pil pil.",

    about: "A Casa do Porco (House of the Pig in Portuguese) is a celebration of pork in myriad forms. At a farm in his hometown of São José do Rio Pardo in São Paulo state, Jefferson Rueda rears local pigs on a natural diet of whey and vegetables. After slaughter in his own slaughterhouse, the chef then makes use of every part of the animal in inventive dishes such as pork jowl sushi and homemade blood sausage. The atmosphere is more fun than fine dining, with a main room adorned with miniature pigs, colourful décor and interesting artefacts from the chef’s travels."

    "Guests can go for pork-based à la carte or even takeaway sandwiches from the fast-food window, but those who wait in line for this no-reservations restaurant should order the O Porco É (Pork is…) degustation. It includes Rueda’s signature pork tartare and crispy pancetta crackling with guava jam as well as the Porco San Zé main course and a version of his wife Janaina’s signature feijoada stew.",

Here, patrons bring their best bottles to sip alongside Chef Kwok Keung Tung’s excellent, produce-driven, seasonal Cantonese cookery."

    "Scroll through The Chairman’s Instagram tags and the dish that proliferates (pictured in every angle imaginable) is Chef Tung’s steamed flowery crab, served in a shallow broth of nutty, aged Shaoxing wine, with chicken oil and slippery flat rice noodles. While other chefs in Hong Kong have tried to replicate this signature dish, the umami-rich version here remains unbeatable.",

With food based on popular global dishes with South African ingredients and twists, Chef Luke Dale-Roberts’s restaurant has two intimate dining areas – one “dark”, one “light”."

    "The experience starts with distinctive small bites from around the world like ceviche and roti paired with cocktails in the quiet dark room. More classic-mod fare is served in the buzzy light room – like eiland (local oryx) carpaccio, local kingklip smoked with curry leaves and scallops with a Cape Malay sabayon.",

The result is a sophisticated – and at times playful – seasonal haute cuisine menu with strong German identity."

    "European influence is welcomed in a city known for racy spices, and strong plates on the three-chapter menu include Frankfurter Grüne Soße and smoked eel;  a one-bite chicken salad; a currywurst street food tribute served in a box complete with wooden fork; and spaetzle egg noodles topped with Alba truffles, all inciting plenty of German culinary nostalgia.",

Guests select four dishes from four sections comprising three seasonal ingredient combinations, before further plates are added to create a bespoke five-, six- or seven-course menu for each diner."

    "Gusty yet delicate flavour reigns supreme. Ceviche-like langoustine is marinated in kombucha before being flamed à table, oysters play bedfellow to goat’s cheese and seaweed while brown crab is paired with chicken liver and veal heart. For a fish course, red mullet is perfectly complemented by brown shrimps and woodruff.",
